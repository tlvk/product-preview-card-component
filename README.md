## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

I built the component with the idea that it could be used for several different product previews in a larger layout. That's why I used an `<h2>` for the product title and used an `<article>` for the card component itself.

### What I learned

- Centering content using `place-content: center;` on the `<body>`
- Changing image based on the screen width using the `<picture>` element

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell: Design to Code // HTML & CSS from scratch](https://youtu.be/Z0duh-0xJ2Y?si=LIRx5Agp591_bG58) - This amazing video helped me to understand how the `<picture>` element works and how to achieve the general layout of the card using CSS grid. I've also been using his naming style for my CSS variables and it has been working great for me.
